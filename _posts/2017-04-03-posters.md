description: You send me the event details and some general ideas of what you want and I'll make a poster for you! See something in the portfolio you like? Let me know. Posters have a flat fee of $10, which gets you a PDF file for printing at your local copy shop. For an extra $5 I'll send you a template in whatever format you want so that you can reuse the same design and just fill in the details yourself. What a deal!
